;; 1. Write the macro when-valid so that it behaves similarly to when. Here is
;; an example of calling it:
;;
;;  (when-valid order-details order-details-validations
;;    (println "It's a success!")
;;    (render :success))
;;
;; When the data is valid, the println and render forms should be evaluated,
;; and when-valid should return nil if the data is invalid


;; 2. You saw that and is implemented as a macro. Implement or as a macro.


;; 3. In Chapter 5 you created a series of functions (c-int, c-str, c-dex)
;; to read an RPG character’s attributes. Write a macro that defines an
;; arbitrary number of attribute-retrieving functions using one macro call.
;; Here’s how you would call it:
;;
;;  (defattrs c-int :intelligence
;;            c-str :strength
;;            c-dex :dexterity)
